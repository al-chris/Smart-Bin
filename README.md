## Overview

This project aims to revolutionize waste management by combining smart technology with environmental sustainability. Using Wokwi's simulation capabilities, we have developed a prototype of a Smart Waste Bin that employs sensors and automation to streamline waste collection and optimize efficiency.

## Key Features

- 🌐 Connected System: The simulation demonstrates a connected wastebin prototype equipped with sensors for real-time waste level detection.

- 📈 Efficient Waste Management: When the wastebin's fill level reaches a certain threshold, notifications are triggered to facilitate timely waste collection and prevent overflow.

- ⚙️ Automatic Lid Mechanism: Through simulated hardware components, we have implemented an automatic lid mechanism for user convenience and hygiene.

- 📊 Data Insights: The project showcases how data collected from these smart waste bins can provide valuable insights into waste generation patterns, leading to improved waste management strategies.
